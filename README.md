# GluttonousSnake
A Gluttonous Snake Game Written by Pascal



## Overview

This game was written by Pascal five years ago,and I shared it on the "[Pascal](http://tieba.baidu.com/p/2517152853)" of the Baidu Tieba.I havenâ€™t changed it since I finished it in the second grade of junior high school,so the code has a lot of redundancy.Also,I don't have any plan to modify it.

## Note

- The code compiled with `Free Pascal 2.0.4 ` , I don't konw what will happen if you compile it with other version,you can have a try.

- The Game is Console Program,so if your Operating System is `Windows 10` ,you must close the `Quick Edit Mode` and `Insertion Mode` of `CMD `.
